Hi!

I'm Fares Grina, a final-year PhD student co-advised by Professor Eric Lefevre at the University of Artois, France, and Professor Zied ELouedi at the University of Tunis (ISG), Tunisia. My research focuses on machine learning, with a particular emphasis on using uncertainty modeling to address imbalanced learning problems.

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science for Decision Making from the University of Tunis (Institut Supérieur de Gestion de Tunis) in Tunisia.

More broadly, I am interested in developing algorithms for reliable and trustworthy machine learning, with a particular focus on generative models, uncertainty estimation, and explainability.
