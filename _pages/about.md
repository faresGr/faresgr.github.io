Hi!

As an R&D and AI Engineer at Talan, Fares Grina is at the forefront of developing innovative AI solutions, building on the foundation of his recently completed PhD. His doctoral research, conducted under the guidance of Professor Eric Lefevre (University of Artois, France) and Professor Zied Elouedi (University of Tunis, ISG, Tunisia), focused on applying uncertainty modeling to solve critical issues in imbalanced machine learning problems, enhancing the robustness and reliability of AI systems.

Fares's expertise extends to broader areas within machine learning, including generative models, uncertainty estimation, and explainable AI—all contributing to the creation of more trustworthy algorithms. He holds Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science for Decision Making from the University of Tunis (Institut Supérieur de Gestion de Tunis).

For collaborations or inquiries, please contact Fares at grina.fares2@gmail.com.
