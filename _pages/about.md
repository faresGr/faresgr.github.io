Hi!

I'm Fares Grina, a final year PhD student co-advised by Pr. Eric Lefevre in University of Artois, France and Pr. Zied ELouedi in University of Tunis (ISG), Tunisia. I work on machine learning with an emphasis on using uncertainty modeling to solve imbalanced learning.

Before my PhD, I received my bachelor and Masters in Computer science for decision making from the Université of Tunis (Institut Supérieur de Gestion de Tunis) in Tunisia.

I am very passionate about solving real world problems using artificial intelligence. My main goal, after PhD, is to work in an AI research position, where I could use the skills I acuired during my PhD and my work experiences, to come up with innovative and efficient ideas to solving industry problems.
